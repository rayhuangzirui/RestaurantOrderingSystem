### My interest of building this project

I am interested in building an application of a restaurant ordering and cashier system because I have worked at a bar as a cashier about 3 years ago.
The ordering system there was so convenient and effectively ease my work. I was wondering how it was implemented by programming.
Now, by learning this course, I am glad that I have an opportunity to implement it on my own.
